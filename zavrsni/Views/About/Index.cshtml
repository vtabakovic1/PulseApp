                <h2>What are Cardiovascular Diseases?</h2>
                <p><strong>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD)</strong> encompass a variety of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. These include coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension. CVDs can lead to severe complications or even death if not managed properly. Factors contributing to CVDs include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking, and genetic predisposition. Early detection and management are crucial in preventing serious outcomes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Coronary artery disease (CAD)</strong> involves the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to atherosclerosis, where cholesterol and fatty deposits build up in the arterial walls. This can reduce blood flow to the heart muscle, potentially leading to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. Risk factors include high cholesterol levels, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle. Management often involves lifestyle changes and medications to improve heart health.</p>

                        <h3>Heart Attack</h3>
                        <p>A <strong>heart attack</strong> occurs when a blood clot obstructs blood flow to a part of the heart muscle, causing ischemia (lack of oxygen) and damage to the heart tissue. This condition is also known as myocardial infarction. Common symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea. Immediate treatment is critical to minimize heart damage and improve recovery outcomes. Risk factors include coronary artery disease, smoking, and obesity.</p>

                        <p>A <strong>stroke</strong> occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is disrupted, either by a blockage (ischemic stroke) or bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke). This interruption in blood flow can lead to the death of brain cells and loss of neurological functions. Symptoms may include sudden numbness, confusion, and difficulty speaking. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Rapid medical intervention is necessary to reduce the extent of brain damage.</p>

It often has no symptoms, making regular monitoring essential. Contributing factors include a high-sodium diet, stress, and genetic predisposition. Effective management includes lifestyle changes and medications to control blood pressure.</p>
